# MoLang
Minecraft's MoLang parser & evaluator implementation in Java

#### What's MoLang
> MoLang is a simple expression-based language designed for fast calculation of values at run-time. Its focus is solely to enable script-like capabilities in high-performance systems where JavaScript is not performant at scale. We need scripting capabilities in these low-level systems to support end-user modding capabilities, custom entities, rendering, and animations.
